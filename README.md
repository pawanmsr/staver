# STAVER

Personal experimentation.

1. Can music be created by simply dragging and dropping music elments on a Stave?  
2. Is it possible to generate sheet music from audio?  

Let's try!  

## Decision roadmap.

1. DFT libraries/packages (for wave comparision).
2. Limitations on timbre of source music?
3. Noise cancellation: high pass, low pass? Libraries/packages?
4. Anchor note? A - 440Hz? Standardization procedure?
5. Include chords or just notes?
6. Animations and graphics and frontend?
7. Build tools?
